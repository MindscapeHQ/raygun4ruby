# Raygun 4 Ruby [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MindscapeHQ/raygun4ruby.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MindscapeHQ/raygun4ruby)

This is the Ruby adapter for the Raygun error reporter, http://raygun.io.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'raygun4ruby'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install raygun4ruby

## Usage

###Rails 3/4

Run:

    rails g raygun:install YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

You can find your API key on your [Raygun Dashboard](https://app.raygun.io/dashboard/)

You can then test your Raygun integration by running:

    rake raygun:test

You should see an "ItWorksException" appear in your Raygun dashboard. You're ready to zap those errors!

NB: Raygun4Ruby currently requires Ruby >= 1.9

### Rails 2

Raygun4Ruby doesn't currently support Rails 2. If you'd like Rails 2 support, [drop us a line](http://raygun.io/forums).

###Standalone / Manual Exception Tracking

```ruby

require 'rubygems'
require 'raygun4ruby'

begin
  # your lovely code here
rescue Exception => e
  Raygun.track_exception(e)
end

```

(You can also pass a Hash as the second parameter to `track_exception`. It should look like a [Rack Env Hash](http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/SPEC.html))

###Resque Error Tracking

Raygun4Ruby also includes a Resque failure backend. You should include it inside your Resque initializer (usually something like `config/initializers/load_resque.rb`)

```ruby
require 'resque/failure/multiple'
require 'resque/failure/raygun'
require 'resque/failure/redis'

Resque::Failure::Multiple.classes = [Resque::Failure::Redis, Resque::Failure::Raygun]
Resque::Failure.backend = Resque::Failure::Multiple
```
